            <h2>Megan Webster</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>CO FOUNDER & CO PRESIDENT</h3>
            <p>Megan is a junior at Walnut Grove Secondary School and is passionate in experiencing firsthand the potential impact of her efforts in enhancing healthcare and improving 
                lives within underserved communities. This has driven her to become the president and founder of the “EduCaring” club within her school community. She has organized 
                multiple education awareness weeks at her school to raise consciousness about the importance of accessible education and equitable opportunities for all. This club makes 
                fundraising initiatives to support the construction of a school in a developing country through an organization called “Class Room Of Hope”. Furthermore, she is the 
                president and founder of youth organizations such as “Rise Against Human Trafficking (RAHT)” which focuses on educating the youth within her community about human 
                trafficking. Human trafficking awareness is crucial as schools often overlook this topic due to its sensitivity, yet ignorance breeds inaction. Megan is also an active 
                volunteer at “Korle-Bu Neuroscience Foundation” which packages abandoned medical equipment to West Africa. These experiences that she has encountered sparked within her a 
                passion for humanitarian endeavours. Megan has additionally obtained various achievements in the field of debate and public speaking. She has won a championship and 1st 
                speaker award at the Harvard Debate Council debate tournament as well as semi-finals/octo-finals at Yale, Brown, Georgetown, Princeton and many other prestigious debate 
                tournaments.</p>
